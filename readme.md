# Homepoint
##### A personal homepage built to be displayed on a spare monitor.


I wanted to do a small-ish project where I made a personal home dashboard that could be displayed using a
Raspberry Pi.

I'm using this opportunity to learn a few new technologies, so everything is sloppy and terrible.

Flask back end, and a react front end. We'll see how it goes.
