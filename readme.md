# RPi Dashboard
### A personal project because I have too much time and a spare Raspberry Pi.

I wanted to do a small-ish project where I made a personal home dashboard that could be displayed using a
Raspberry Pi.

I'm using this opportunity to learn a few new technologies, so everything is sloppy and terrible.

Flask back end, and a react front end. We'll see how it goes.

*Any use of the word "loli" within documentation or code does **not** refer to pornographic material. That is simply the name of my Raspberry Pi*
