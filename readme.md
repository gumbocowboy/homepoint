*Homepoint is a personal project I'm using to learn new technlogies, so it will be evolving and breaking for a while.*

The front-end (`homepoint`) is being built using React, while the back-end api (`motherbase`) is using Flask.
My original intention was to build something that could be run full time on a Raspberry Pi and navigated using a touch screen.

Content is displayed in a grid format using Panes or Widgets to display data ingested from `motherbase`.

## Current Features
- A clock! See the time in all it's up-to-date glory!
- A countdown timer until my wedding. :heart:
- Local Weather
- Amount of different media types saved to local Hard Drive 
- Show amount of devices connected to the network
- Create list of known devices to keep track of unwanted network access

## Planned Features
- Display a list of known devices connected to the network.
- List all unknown device IPs and Mac Addresses
- Display remaining hard drive space
- And More!

## Setup
**I absolutely 100% recommend you do not attempt to clone or set up Homepoint at this time.**
